# üö® URGENT FIX - CORS Connection Issue

## Problem
The frontend on Vercel is showing connection errors because the backend on Render needs to be redeployed with the updated CORS settings.

## Status
- ‚úÖ **Frontend**: Deployed to Vercel at https://customer-service-agent-black.vercel.app
- ‚ùå **Backend**: Needs manual redeployment on Render.com with CORS fixes

## Immediate Action Required

### 1. Redeploy Backend on Render.com
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Find your service "customer-service-agent-api"
3. Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)

### 2. Verify Fix
After backend redeployment, test the live site:
```bash
# Test backend health
curl https://customer-service-agent-api.onrender.com/health

# Test frontend connection
# Visit: https://customer-service-agent-black.vercel.app
# Submit any query to test the connection
```

## What Was Fixed
- ‚úÖ Updated CORS settings to allow Vercel domain
- ‚úÖ Added permissive CORS for production environment
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling and debugging
- ‚úÖ Fixed environment detection in frontend
- ‚úÖ Added detailed logging for troubleshooting

## CORS Settings Added
```python
# New CORS origins include:
"https://customer-service-agent-black.vercel.app"  # Your specific Vercel URL
"https://*.vercel.app"  # All Vercel deployments
allow_origins=["*"] if os.getenv("VERCEL") else CORS_ORIGINS  # Permissive for production
```

## Expected Result
After backend redeployment, the frontend should successfully connect and process queries without errors.

## Backup Plan
If the issue persists after redeployment, we can:
1. Enable more verbose logging
2. Use a CORS proxy service temporarily
3. Deploy to alternative platforms (Railway, Netlify)

---
**Time-sensitive**: The backend redeploy should take less than 5 minutes to fix the issue completely.
